<h1>Pet Shelter</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
The Pet Shelter Management System is a Java, terminal-based application designed to streamline the operations of animal shelters.
it provides a user-friendly way to manage pets, track adoptions, applications, and enable users to browse based on specific criteria.
This program demonstrates core OOP concepts while integrating real-world functionality like user management, filtering, and form validation.

This checklist is meant for features that are not fully imlplemented. <br>
<ul>
  <li>- [ ] Browsing Functionality</li>
  <li>- [ ] User Console</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
Java was the first langauage I fully explored and learned. This project wasn't hard to build at all. However, this has led me to feel dissapointed.
I would like to challenge myself harder next time and explore concepts I'm not familiar with
